    Welcome to the Angular Wanted App, a demo project that showcases how to use Angular, Angular Material, and Firebase
    to create a web app that displays information about the FBIâ€™s most wanted fugitives. ðŸš¨
    <br />
    <br />
    With this app, you can:
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Browse the list of fugitives and see their photos, descriptions, and charges ðŸ‘€</li>
      <li>View the details of each fugitive and share them with others ðŸ“²</li>
      <li>Learn more about the FBI Wanted program ðŸ’¡</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    This app is powered by the following technologies:
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Angular, a framework for building web applications with TypeScript</li>
      <li>Angular Material, a UI component library that implements the Material Design specifications</li>
      <li>
        Firebase, a platform that provides backend services, such as hosting, authentication, database, and analytics
      </li>
      <li>
        RxJS, a library for reactive programming using Observables, which are collections of future values or events
        that can be composed and manipulated with operators
      </li>
      <li>
